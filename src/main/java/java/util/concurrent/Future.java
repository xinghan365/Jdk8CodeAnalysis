/**
 * A Future计算的结果。 提供方法来检查计算是否完成，等待其完成，并检索计算结果。 结果只能在计算完成后使用方法get进行检索，如有必要，阻塞，直到准备就绪。 取消由cancel方法执行。 提供其他方法来确定任务是否正常完成或被取消。 计算完成后，不能取消计算。 如果您想使用Future ，以便不可撤销，但不提供可用的结果，则可以声明Future<?>表格的类型，并返回null作为基础任务的结果。
 * 示例使用 （请注意，以下课程都是化妆品。）
 *
 *    interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); } class App { ExecutorService executor = ... ArchiveSearcher searcher = ... void showSearch(final String target) throws InterruptedException { Future<String> future = executor.submit(new Callable<String>() { public String call() { return searcher.search(target); }}); displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching try { displayText(future.get()); // use future } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; } } }
 * FutureTask类是实现Future ，实现Runnable ，所以可以由Executor执行。 例如，以上建设与submit可以替换为：
 *    FutureTask<String> future = new FutureTask<String>(new Callable<String>() { public String call() { return searcher.search(target); }}); executor.execute(future);
 * 内存一致性影响：异步运算采取的操作happen-before操作在另一个线程中相应的Future.get() Future.get() 。
 *
 * A {@code Future} represents the result of an asynchronous
 * computation.  Methods are provided to check if the computation is
 * complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
 * the computation.  The result can only be retrieved using method
 * {@code get} when the computation has completed, blocking if
 * necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation is performed by the
 * {@code cancel} method.  Additional methods are provided to
 * determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
 * computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
 * If you would like to use a {@code Future} for the sake
 * of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
 * declare types of the form {@code Future<?>} and
 * return {@code null} as a result of the underlying task.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Sample Usage</b> (Note that the following classes are all
 * made-up.)
 * <pre> {@code
 * interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 * class App {
 *   ExecutorService executor = ...
 *   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
 *   void showSearch(final String target)
 *       throws InterruptedException {
 *     Future<String> future
 *       = executor.submit(new Callable<String>() {
 *         public String call() {
 *             return searcher.search(target);
 *         }});
 *     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
 *     try {
 *       displayText(future.get()); // use future
 *     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The {@link FutureTask} class is an implementation of {@code Future} that
 * implements {@code Runnable}, and so may be executed by an {@code Executor}.
 * For example, the above construction with {@code submit} could be replaced by:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * FutureTask<String> future =
 *   new FutureTask<String>(new Callable<String>() {
 *     public String call() {
 *       return searcher.search(target);
 *   }});
 * executor.execute(future);}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"> <i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions following the corresponding {@code Future.get()} in another thread.
 *
 * @see FutureTask
 * @see Executor
 * @since 1.5
 * @author Doug Lea
 * @param <V> The result type returned by this Future's {@code get} method
