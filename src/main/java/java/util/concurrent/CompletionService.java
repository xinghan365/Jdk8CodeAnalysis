/**
 * 一种将新异步任务的生产与已完成任务的结果消耗相分离的服务。 生产者submit执行任务。 消费者take完成任务并按照完成的顺序处理其结果。 甲CompletionService可以例如被用来管理异步I / O，其中执行读取的程序或系统的一个组成部分被提交，然后任务在程序的不同部分采取行动在所涉及的读出完成时，可能当不同于他们要求的顺序。
 * 通常， CompletionService依靠单独的Executor来实际执行任务，在这种情况下， CompletionService仅管理内部完成队列。 ExecutorCompletionService类提供了这种方法的实现。
 *
 * 内存一致性效果：提交任务的前行动线程CompletionService happen-before由该任务所采取的行动，进而发生，之前从以下相应的成功返回行动take() 。
 *
 * A service that decouples the production of new asynchronous tasks
 * from the consumption of the results of completed tasks.  Producers
 * {@code submit} tasks for execution. Consumers {@code take}
 * completed tasks and process their results in the order they
 * complete.  A {@code CompletionService} can for example be used to
 * manage asynchronous I/O, in which tasks that perform reads are
 * submitted in one part of a program or system, and then acted upon
 * in a different part of the program when the reads complete,
 * possibly in a different order than they were requested.
 *
 * <p>Typically, a {@code CompletionService} relies on a separate
 * {@link Executor} to actually execute the tasks, in which case the
 * {@code CompletionService} only manages an internal completion
 * queue. The {@link ExecutorCompletionService} class provides an
 * implementation of this approach.
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to
 * submitting a task to a {@code CompletionService}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions taken by that task, which in turn <i>happen-before</i>
 * actions following a successful return from the corresponding {@code take()}.
