/**
 * A BlockingQueue其中生产者可以等待消费者接收元素。 A TransferQueue可用于例如消息传递应用程序，其中生产者有时（使用方法transfer(E) ）等待消费者调用take或poll ，而在其他时间，等待元素（通过方法put ）而不等待接收。 Non-blocking和time-out版本的tryTransfer也可用。 甲TransferQueue也可以查询，经由hasWaitingConsumer() ，是否有等待项，这是一种相反的类似于一个任何线程peek操作。
 * 像其他阻塞队列一样， TransferQueue可能是容量有限的。 如果是这样，尝试的转移操作可以最初阻止等待可用空间，和/或随后阻止等待消费者的接收。 请注意，在与零容量的队列，如SynchronousQueue ， put和transfer是有效的代名词。
 *
 * A {@link BlockingQueue} in which producers may wait for consumers
 * to receive elements.  A {@code TransferQueue} may be useful for
 * example in message passing applications in which producers
 * sometimes (using method {@link #transfer}) await receipt of
 * elements by consumers invoking {@code take} or {@code poll}, while
 * at other times enqueue elements (via method {@code put}) without
 * waiting for receipt.
 * {@linkplain #tryTransfer(Object) Non-blocking} and
 * {@linkplain #tryTransfer(Object,long,TimeUnit) time-out} versions of
 * {@code tryTransfer} are also available.
 * A {@code TransferQueue} may also be queried, via {@link
 * #hasWaitingConsumer}, whether there are any threads waiting for
 * items, which is a converse analogy to a {@code peek} operation.
 *
 * <p>Like other blocking queues, a {@code TransferQueue} may be
 * capacity bounded.  If so, an attempted transfer operation may
 * initially block waiting for available space, and/or subsequently
 * block waiting for reception by a consumer.  Note that in a queue
 * with zero capacity, such as {@link SynchronousQueue}, {@code put}
 * and {@code transfer} are effectively synonymous.
